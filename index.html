                <strong><i>Abstract:</i></strong> What I will research in my
                master’s thesis <em>Breaking Storytelling Narratives</em> can be
                observed surprisingly clearly in the world of consumption as
                well. We live in narratives which we’ve never chosen. The
                question now is: How can we break through them?
                <br />
              </p>
              <p>
                To clarify the connection, it’s worth to start with an
                observation. People collect, buy and own things not only because
                they need them. They do it because they are told the objects
                have a meaning. Status, certainty, identity, success, belonging
                and even a certain freedom. Because of that, consumption objects
                are less items and more mini-narratives, which we carry around.
                We carry them in our backpacks, in the wardrobe and in our
                instagram feed.
                <br />
              </p>
              <p>
                But if everything is a narrative, can design break it? <br />

                Consumption culture is no longer the act of buying. It is a way
                of storytelling, a system that has taught us over many years how
                to read meaning, identity, and belonging. Each object, a jacket,
                an old image, a smartphone and even a NFT* explains a story.
                More often than not, it’s not our own. It is a product of
                advertising, habit, expectations, and social patterns.
                <br />(Baudrillard, 1970) <br /><br />
              </p>
              <p>
                Every advertisement is, at its core, a small story. It shows us
                not only the reality of a product, but also a possible world in
                which the product has its own role. A t-shirt is not just a
                t-shirt. It’s a symbol of youth, rebellion, sustainability,
                style, belonging to a subculture or in case of fast fashion, a
                symbol of availability. <br />(Barthes, 1957;Joy et al., 2012)
                <br />
              </p>
              <p>Brands tell us: “This is you if you buy this.” <br /><br /></p>
              <p>
                The world of consumption follows the same mechanisms as
                classical storytelling. <br />

                There is a hero (this is us). <br />
                There is a promise (who can we become). <br />
                There is a transformation (act of buying) <br />
                There is a feeling of finishing (short term) <br />
              </p>

                *NFT stands for ‘non-fungible token’. Non-fungible means that
                something is unique and can’t be replaced. By contrast, physical
                money and cryptocurrencies are fungible, which means they can be
                traded or exchanged for one another. Every NFT contains a
                digital signature which makes each one unique. NFTs are digital
                assets and can be photos, videos, audio files, or any another
                digital format. Examples of NFT examples include artwork, comic
                books, sports collectibles, trading cards, games and more.<br />

              </p>
              <p>
                At the first sight, minimalism looks like the opposite. Buy
                less, own less, use less. But even minimalism is a narrative. It
                has its own images, for example empty rooms, perfectly folded
                clothes or the same neutral colors. In addition it has its own
                rituals like throwing away, reducing and its own promises such
                as clarity, freedom and focus. <br />
              </p>
              <p>
                Minimalism as well sells its identity but with less objects.
              </p>
              <p>(Kondo, 2010) <br /><br /></p>
              <p>
                The interesting part in this is: minimalist lifestyles break
                certain consumption narratives, but at the same time they create
                new ones. A minimalistic apartment is just as much a statement
                like a high-tech-desk. The question, then, is not whether we
                need narratives, but which ones we choose by our own and which
                ones steer us without us noticing it. <br />
              </p>
              <p>
                For <em>Breaking Storytelling Narratives</em> it means we can
                not just turn off narratives. But we can make them visible and
                even distort them, shift them, and recombine them. <br />
              </p>
              <p>
                Minimalism helps us to see how much the “more” of consumption is
                often just a well-told story. At the same time, it shows us
                every “less” is framed in a narrative as well. <br />(Ivanhoe,
                2020)

                *Counter-narratives are stories that convey the experiences and
                perspectives of historically oppressed, excluded, or silenced
                groups, particularly in educational contexts. They serve to
                validate these perspectives and challenge dominant hegemonic
                narratives, making them valuable tools in equity courses and
                teacher education programs. <br />(„Counter-narratives”, o. J.)

                An important part of my master thesis is, how visual media can
                evoke reflection in the viewer. In the field of consumption, we
                can observe this in souvenirs like a t-shirt from Paris or a
                grandfather's watch.<br />(Csikszentmihalyi & Rochberg-Halton,
                1981)<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                Such objects are no longer products. They are frozen moments.
                Their meaning is not influenced by advertising or consumption
                structures, it’s simply the unique life-story.
                <br />(Belk, 1988)<br /><br />
              </p>
              <p>
                This shows me that objects can have narratives, which are more
                authentic than what the consumption culture tells us. This is
                relevant to my research interest, because it shows that
                narratives can emerge from completely unexpected material.
              </p>
              <p>
                For my research interest, this is relevant because it proves
                that narratives can emerge from completely unexpected material.
                An object can have its own story, without following the typical
                definition of a “Story”. My question now is: What happens when
                storytelling doesn’t explain, but instead leaves space for
                personal meaning?<br />
              </p>
              <p>That’s one of the central ideas driving my thesis project.</p>

                NFTs, skins, game items or virtual mods don’t even exist in a
                physical form. Still people pay money for them. Why? Because
                digital products are narrative objects only. They only exist as
                a meaning or a symbol. It’s similar to the brand fashion but in
                a digital space, where identity is even faster and more
                flexible. Digital objects show how quick narratives are created,
                as soon as people look for meaning in them.
                <br />(Kerin et al., 2021; Nakamura, 2020)<br /><br />
              </p>
              <p>
                NFTs are basically the most extreme way of storytelling. An
                image receives a value, because the story behind it has been
                sold. The story is the reason an object receives value, not the
                object itself. For me, this shows me how fragile narrative
                structures in the digital space can be and how easily they can
                be broken or reordered.<br />

                When we ask why people collect, buy, and own things, we arrive
                at a simple truth. We follow stories. Whether if it’s about
                sustainable fashion, minimalism, NFTs or old images, there is
                always a story behind them. That is why the connection to my
                thesis is so strong. Storytelling is not just a method in movie,
                it’s as well a structure in our daily lives.<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                And if storytelling is everywhere, then design has the task not
                only to use it, but to research it, irritate it, challenge it
                and recombine it.<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                An interactive shortfilm, that breaks narratives, is a perfect
                tool for this. Because it works like our consumer culture. It
                offers options, evokes expectation, shows alternatives, forces
                choices and leaves space for personal interpretation. This is
                how everything comes together. Consumer culture tells stories,
                often without being asked.<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                Experimental storytelling tells less, but shows more.<br /><br />
              </p>
              <p>
                And that’s where the possibility for reflection emerges. About
                ownership, about objects, about technology, about nature, and
                last but not least about ourselves.

                <strong><i>Abstract: </i></strong>This text examines materialism
                as a psychological value orientation and its association with
                psychological well-being. Drawing on research from
                self-determination theory, hedonic adaptation and social
                comparison theory, it outlines key mechanisms through which
                materialistic values are linked to lower life satisfaction and
                increased psychological distress. The findings suggest that
                materialism emphasizes external rewards and unstable sources of
                self-worth, limiting its capacity to support long-term
                well-being.<br />

                Materialism is a central feature of modern consumer societies,
                where goods are valued not only for their practical use but also
                for their symbolic meaning in terms of identity and social
                status. Advertising and social media reinforce this orientation
                by linking consumption to success and per-sonal value. From a
                psychological perspective, this raises the question of how a
                strong focus on material values relates to individual
                well-being.

                In psychology, materialism is commonly understood as a value
                orientation in which money, possessions, and consumption are
                seen as important sources of happiness, success and social
                recognition.<br />(Kasser & Ryan, 1996)
              </p>
              <p>
                Across many studies, materialism is consistently linked to lower
                levels of personal well-being. People who strongly prioritize
                wealth, image and external success tend to report less life
                satisfaction and more psychological strain compared to those who
                focus on personal growth, relationships and meaningful
                experiences. <br />(Kasser & Ryan, 1996; Dittmar et al., 2014)
                <br /><br />
              </p>
              <p>
                This distinction is often described as the difference between
                external and internal life goals. Exter-nal goals focus on
                approval, appearance and social status, while internal goals
                focus on relationships, self-development and emotional
                connection. Research suggests that a strong focus on external
                goals is less strongly associated with long-term well-being.

                One important psychological mechanism related to consumption and
                materialism is hedonic adaptation. This concept refers to the
                tendency for emotional reactions to positive events, including
                material gains, to be temporary, as individuals often adapt to
                changes in their circumstances over time. As a result, increases
                in happiness following consumption tend to diminish, which
                limits the long-term impact of material goods on subjective
                well-being.<br />(Diener et al., 2006). <br /><br />
              </p>
              <p>
                Another important factor in consumption-driven behaviour is
                social comparison. According to Festinger’s (1954) social
                comparison theory, individuals evaluate their abilities and
                opinions by comparing themselves to others, particularly in the
                absence of objective standards. In contemporary, media-saturated
                environments, idealized representations of lifestyles and
                consumption patterns can intensify such comparisons, which may
                contribute to feelings of dissatisfaction or inadequacy. In this
                context, materialistic consumption may serve as a short-term
                coping response aimed at restoring a sense of belonging or
                social status.<br />(Festinger, 1954) <br /><br />
              </p>
              <p>
                Advertising can further amplify these psychological mechanisms
                by associating products with emotional and symbolic meanings
                rather than purely functional attributes. Research on judgment
                and decision-making suggests that many everyday decisions are
                strongly influenced by intuitive and automatic cognitive
                processes, rather than by deliberate rational analysis.<br />(Kahneman,
                2012)<br /><br />
              </p>
              <p>
                These insights help explain why advertising appeals that target
                emotions such as social belonging or fear of missing out can be
                particularly effective, thereby addressing psychological motives
                that extend beyond the functional value of consumer goods.

                As mentioned, a strong materialistic value orientation has been
                consistently associated with lower life satisfaction and poorer
                psychological well-being. Individuals who place high importance
                on extrinsic goals such as wealth and social status report, on
                average, higher levels of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and
                other indicators of psychological distress than those who
                prioritize intrinsic goals. <br />(Kasser et al., 2014)<br /><br />
              </p>
              <p>
                One central explanation for this association lies in the
                instability of externally defined self-worth. Within the
                framework of Self-Determination Theory, materialism is
                understood as a value orientation that emphasizes external
                rewards and approval. A strong focus on possessions, income, and
                status may interfere with the satisfaction of basic
                psychological needs, namely autonomy, competence and
                relatedness, which in turn increases vulnerability to
                psychological distress. <br />(Dittmar et al., 2014)<br /><br />
              </p>
              <p>
                Materialistic values may also shift attention away from
                non-material sources of well-being. Empirical research suggests
                that higher materialism is associated with lower quality of
                social relationships, reduced engagement in meaningful
                activities and lower overall need satisfaction. Over time, this
                imbalance can contribute to experiences of reduced emotional
                fulfilment and social connectedness, as personal resources are
                increasingly directed toward consumption rather than personal
                development or social bonds. <br />(Kasser et al., 2014)

                Overall, psychological research suggests that a strong
                materialistic value orientation is associated with lower
                long-term well-being, primarily because it emphasizes external
                rewards and unstable sources of self-worth. While consumption
                can provide short-term satisfaction, it often fails to fulfil
                basic psychological needs, making materialism a fragile and
                ultimately ineffective pathway to lasting well-being.

                Personal possessions function as carriers of memory, identity
                and emotional attachment in several ways. They act as cues to
                past experiences and relationships, help anchor and stabilize
                identity across time and space, and symbolize personal history
                and self-development. These functions can also support the
                transmission of memories and values across generations. However,
                the emotional significance of possessions is shaped by factors
                such as genders and socioeconomic status, and tends to weaken in
                contexts of high mobility, where practical use-value often
                outweighs symbolic meaning.

                The studies reveal multiple mechanisms through which possessions
                function as memory carriers. Possessions serve as symbols of
                interpersonal ties with others and as cues to past experiences.
                Among functional hoarders, possessions are perceived as threats
                to memory when considered for disposal, indicating their
                significant role in memory preservation (Cherrier and Ponnor,
                2010).<br />
                For older consumers, cherished possessions play a significant
                role in reminiscence and life review, triggering memories
                related to life events and personal history. These possessions
                carry the “storied nature of meanings” that older consumers
                attach to them, with memory functions bundled with life review
                and disposition concerns. Possessions are involved in narrative
                construction or storytelling as they are used to pass on
                personal and familial legacies (Price et al., 2000).<br /><br />
              </p>

                Scrapbooks represent a specialized form of memory-carrying
                possession. They function to collect, reconstruct and protect
                autobiographical memories. The scrapbook preserves photographs
                and mementos, associating them with narrative and ornamentation.
                Memory protection strategies employed by scrapbookers include
                overcollection of memory markers and increased journaling. These
                modes of memory reconstruction are cued by the scrapbook itself,
                serving as aide-memoires (Phillips, 2016).<br />
                The elderly use possessions for mnemonic purposes, with objects
                acting as memory cues (Mccracken, 1987).<br />
                Possessions are linked to identity and serve as carriers of
                memory and personal history, storing memories of relationships
                and personal experiences. Photo-elicitation research
                demonstrates that possessions trigger memories and are used in
                narrative construction (Whitmore, 2001).<br />
                However, one study presents a contrasting perspective. In the
                context of global nodanism, possessions do not function as
                significant carriers of memory. Global nomads do not form strong
                attachments to possessions and lack of importance placed on
                curation indicate that possessions do not serve as memory
                carriers in this mobile context (Bardhi et al., 2012).

                The studies consistently demonstrates that possessions reflect
                and construct personal identity, though the mechanisms and
                intensity vary across populations. Possessions reflect personal
                identity by being considered important for their instrumental,
                pragmatic and self-referent features for men, while women see
                them as symbolizing interpersonal integration and emotional
                attachment. A theoretical continuum from function/self-oriented
                to symbolic/other-oriented meanings illuminates how possessions
                reflect gender identity (Dittmar, 1989).<br />
                Business commuters view possessions as unique symbols of their
                personal history and self-development, using possessions to
                communicate personal history and professional identity (Dittmar,
                1991).<br />
                Possessions anchor and stabilize identity in space, providing a
                sense of belonging. During geographical moves, possessions help
                sustain connections to places and the self, and they manage
                temporality by connecting past, present, and future selves
                (Bardhi et al., 2012). <br /><br />
              </p>
              <p>
                For older consumers, possessions carry symbolic meanings that
                are part of personal narratives, essential for identity
                construction. These possessions are used in self-presentation
                and communication to others through controlled meaning transfer,
                connecting to personal history and self-development by passing
                on legacies and achieving symbolic immortality (Price et al.,
                2000).<br />
                Possessions are bundled with personal history and used to
                transfer this history to younger generations. The act of passing
                possessions to younger generations serves as a form of
                self-presentation and communication of identity (Curasi,
                2011).<br />
                Among the elderly, possessions are critical for
                self-recognition, reconciliation, and reflection in the last
                stage of life, assisting in the active construction of
                identities and embodying individual, social, and existential
                narratives (Whitmore, 2001).<br />In global nomadism, however,
                possessions are less salient as identity carriers and are valued
                more for instrumental use-value. This represents a “liquid”
                relationship to possessions characterized by detachment and
                flexibility, where possessions are valued for their temporary
                and situational use-value rather than for identity formation or
                emotional attachment (Bardhi et al., 2012).

                Emotional attachment to possessions manifests through multiple
                dimensions across the studies. Women regard possessions as
                important because they symbolize interpersonal integration and
                emotional attachment (Dittmar, 1989).<br />
                Among unemployed individuals, possessions demonstrate emotional,
                mood-adjusting features that provide comfort (Dittmar, 1991).<br />
                Functional hoarders perceive possessions as providing security,
                with throwing away seen as a threat to this security.
                Possessions serve as symbols of interpersonal ties with others
                (Cherrier and Ponnor, 2010).<br />
                For older consumers, cherished possessions evoke strong and
                ambivalent emotions. Concerns about disposition involve avoiding
                intrafamilial conflict and exercising control over the future
                life of possessions. Intergenerational attachment processes
                involve passing on personal and familial legacies and achieving
                symbolic immortality (Price et al., 2000).<br /><br />
              </p>
              <p>
                Sentimental possessions create reluctance to donate, as
                consumers experience perceived identity loss when considering
                donation of sentimental goods. Memory preservation strategies,
                such as taking photos of possessions before donating, help
                ameliorate this perceived identity loss (Winterich et al.,
                2017).<br />
                In intergenerational transfers, older consumers are emotionally
                attached to their possessions and worry about younger family
                members not caring about these cherished items. Possessions
                serve to maintain family identity through intergenerational
                transfer processes. Females demonstrate higher valuing of
                cherished possessions than males (Curasi, 2011).<br />
                The elderly use possessions to negotiate transitions in self and
                status definition, and possessions serve as instruments of
                cross-generational influence (Mccracken, 1987).<br />
                Among Florida retirees, attachment intensity is high due to
                possessions’ central role in identity and aging, with emotional
                significance implying comfort and mood-regulating functions
                (Whitmore, 2001).<br />
                Again, global nomads present an exception, where emotional
                connections to possessions are not salient, emotional responses
                to possession loss or transfer are not significant, and
                attachment intensity is generally lower than in other
                populations (Bardhi et al., 2012).
