                Consumption culture is no longer the act of buying. It is a way
                of storytelling, a system that has taught us over many years how
                to read meaning, identity, and belonging. Each object, a jacket,
                an old image, a smartphone and even a NFT explains a Story. More
                often than not, it’s not our own. It is a product of
                advertising, habit, expectations, and social patterns.

                What I will research in my master’s thesis Breaking Storytelling
                Narratives can be observed surprisingly clearly in the world of
                consumption as well. We live in narratives which we’ve never
                choosen. The question now is: How can we break through them?
                <br />

              </p>
              <p>
                To clarify the connection, it’s worth to start with an
                observation. People collect, buy and own things not only because
                they need it. People do it because they got told the object has
                a meaning. Status, certainty, identity, success, belonging and
                even a certain freedom. Because of that, consumption object are
                less items and more mini-narratives, which we carry around. We
                carry them in the backpack, in the wardrobe and in our instagram
                feed.
                <br />

              </p>
              <p>
                But if everything is a narrative, can design break it? <br />

                Every advertisement is, at its core, a small story. It shows us
                not only the reality of a product, more of a possible world in
                which the product has its own role. A t-shirt is not just a
                t-shirt. It’s a symbol of youth, rebellion, sustainability,
                style, belonging to a subculture or in case of fast fashion;
                availability. <br />(Barthes, 1957), (Joy et al., 2012) <br />

              <p>
                The world of consumption follows the same mechanisms as
                classical storytelling. <br />

                There is a hero (this is us). <br />
                There is a promise (who can we become). <br />
                There is a transformation (act of buying) <br />
                There is a feeling of finishing (short term) <br />

              </p>
              <p>
                In the first sight, minimalism looks like the opposite. Buy
                less, own less, use less. But even minimalism is a narrative. It
                has its own images, for example empty rooms, perfect folded
                clothes or the same neutral colors. In addition it has its own
                rituals like throwing away, reducing and its own promises such
                as clarity, freedom and focus. <br />

              </p>
              <p>
                Minimalism as well sells its identity but with less objects.

              </p>
              <p>
                (Kondo, 2011) <br /><br />

              </p>
              <p>
                The interesting part in this is: minimalist lifestyles break
                certain consumption narratives, but at the same time they create
                new ones. A minimalistic apartment is as well a statement like a
                high tech-desk. The question, then, is not whether we need
                narratives, but which ones we choose by our own and which ones
                steer us without us noticing. <br />

              </p>
              <p>
                For Breaking Storytelling Narratives it means we can not just
                turn of narratives. But we can make them visible and even
                distort them, shift them, recombine them. <br />

              </p>
              <p>
                Minimalism helps us see how much the “more” of consumption was
                often just a well-told story. At the same time, it shows us
                every “less” is framed in a narrative as well. <br />(Ivanhoe,
                2020)

                *Counter-narratives are stories that convey the experiences and
                perspectives of historically oppressed, excluded, or silenced
                groups, particularly in educational contexts. They serve to
                validate these perspectives and challenge dominant hegemonic
                narratives, making them valuable tools in equity courses and
                teacher education programs. <br />(„Counter-narratives”, o. J.)

                An important part of my master thesis is, how visual media can
                evoke reflection in the viewer. In the field of consumption, we
                can observe this in souvenirs like a t-shirt from Paris or a
                grandfathers watch.<br />(Csikszentmihalyi & Rochberg-Halton,
                1981)<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                Objects like this are no longer products. They are frozen
                moments. Their meaning is not influenced by advertising or
                consumption structures, it’s only the one life-story.
                <br />(Belk, 1988)<br /><br />
              </p>
              <p>
                This shows me, objects can have narratives, which are more
                authentic than what the consumption culture is telling us. For my research interest, this is relevant because it proves
                that narratives can emerge from completely unexpected material.

                For my research interest, this is relevant because it proves
                that narratives can emerge from completely unexpected material.
                An object can have a story, without having the typical
                “Story”. My question now is: What happens when storytelling doesn’t
                explain, but instead leaves space for personal meaning?<br />
              </p>
              <p>That’s one of the central ideas driving my thesis project.</p>

                NFTs, skins, game items or virtual mods don’t even exist in its
                physical form. Still people pay money for it. Why? Because digital products are narrative objects only. They only
                exist as a meaning or a symbol. It’s similar to the brand
                fashion but in a digital field, where identity is even faster
                and more flexible. Digital objects shows how quick narratives
                gets created, as soon people want to see a meaning in it.
                <br />(Kerin et al., 2021),(Nakamura, 2020)<br /><br />
              </p>
              <p>
                NFTs are basically the most extreme way of Storytelling. An
                image receive a value, because the story about it is got sold.
                The story is the reason an object receives value, not the object
                itself. For me, this shows me how fragile narrative structures in the
                digital field can be and how easy it is to break or reorder
                them.<br />

                When we ask why people collect, buy, and own things, we arrive
                at a simple truth. We follow stories. Whatever if it’s about
                sustainable Fashion, minimalism, NFTs or old images, there is
                always a story behind. Thats why the connection to my thesis is
                that strong. Storytelling is not just a method of a movie, it’s
                as well a structure in our daily life.<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                And if storytelling is everywhere, then design has the task not
                only to use it, but to research it, irritate it, deconstruct it
                and recombine it.<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                An interactive shortfilm, that breaks narratives, is a perfect
                tool for it. Because it works like our consumer culture. It
                offers options, evokes expectation, shows alternatives, forces
                choices and keeps space for own interpretation. This is how everything comes together. Consumer culture tells stories, often without being asked.<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                Experimental storytelling tells less, but shows more.<br /><br />
              </p>
              <p>
                And that’s where the possibility for reflection emerges. About
                ownership, about objects, about technology, about nature, and
                last but not least about ourselves.

                <strong><i>Abstract: </i></strong>This text examines materialism as a psychological value orientation and its association with psychological well-being. Drawing on research from self-determination theory, hedonic adap-tation and social comparison theory, it outlines key mechanisms through which materialistic values are linked to lower life satisfaction and increased psychological distress. The findings suggest that materialism emphasizes external rewards and unstable sources of self-worth, limiting its capacity to support long-term well-being.<br />
                <br />
              </p>
              <p>Materialism is a central feature of modern consumer societies, where goods are valued not only for their practical use but also for their symbolic meaning in terms of identity and social status. Advertising and social media reinforce this orientation by linking consumption to success and per-sonal value. From a psychological perspective, this raises the question of how a strong focus on material values relates to individual well-being.</p>

                In psychology, materialism is commonly understood as a value orientation in which money, pos-sessions, and consumption are seen as important sources of happiness, success and social recog-nition<br />(Kasser & Ryan, 1996).
                </p>
              <p>
                Across many studies, materialism is consistently linked to lower levels of personal well-being. Peo-ple who strongly prioritize wealth, image and external success tend to report less life satisfaction and more psychological strain compared to those who focus on personal growth, relationships and meaningful experiences <br />(Kasser & Ryan, 1996; Dittmar et al., 2014).
                <br /><br /></p>
              <p>
                This distinction is often described as the difference between external and internal life goals. Exter-nal goals focus on approval, appearance and social status, while internal goals focus on relation-ships, self-development and emotional connection. Research suggests that a strong focus on ex-ternal goals is less strongly associated with long-term well-being <br />(Kasser & Ryan, 1996).

                One important psychological mechanism related to consumption and materialism is hedonic ad-aptation. This concept refers to the tendency for emotional reactions to positive events, including material gains, to be temporary, as individuals often adapt to changes in their circumstances over time. As a result, increases in happiness following consumption tend to diminish, which limits the long-term impact of material goods on subjective well-being<br />(Diener et al., 2006).
                <br /><br /></p>
              <p>
                Another important factor in consumption-driven behaviour is social comparison. According to Festinger’s (1954) social comparison theory, individuals evaluate their abilities and opinions by comparing themselves to others, particularly in the absence of objective standards. In contempo-rary, media-saturated environments, idealized representations of lifestyles and consumption pat-terns can intensify such comparisons, which may contribute to feelings of dissatisfaction or inade-quacy. In this context, materialistic consumption may serve as a short-term coping response aimed at restoring a sense of belonging or social status<br />(Festinger, 1954).
                <br /><br /></p><p>
                Advertising can further amplify these psychological mechanisms by associating products with emo-tional and symbolic meanings rather than purely functional attributes. Research on judgment and decision-making suggests that many everyday decisions are strongly influenced by intuitive and automatic cognitive processes, rather than by deliberate rational analysis<br />(Kahneman, 2012).<br /><br />
              </p><p>
                These insights help explain why advertising appeals that target emotions such as social belonging
                or fear of missing out can be particularly effective, thereby addressing psychological motives that
                extend beyond the functional value of consumer goods.

                As mentioned, a strong materialistic value orientation has been consistently associated with lower
                life satisfaction and poorer psychological well-being. Individuals who place high importance on
                extrinsic goals such as wealth and social status report, on average, higher levels of depressive
                symptoms, anxiety, and other indicators of psychological distress than those who prioritize intrinsic
                goals <br />(Kasser et al., 2014).<br /><br />
              </p>
              <p>
                One central explanation for this association lies in the instability of externally defined self-worth.
                Within the framework of Self-Determination Theory, materialism is understood as a value orientation
                that emphasizes external rewards and approval. A strong focus on possessions, income, and
                status may interfere with the satisfaction of basic psychological needs, namely autonomy, competence
                and relatedness, which in turn increases vulnerability to psychological distress <br />(Dittmar et
                al., 2014).<br /><br />
              </p>
              <p>
                Materialistic values may also shift attention away from non-material sources of well-being. Empirical
                research suggests that higher materialism is associated with lower quality of social relationships,
                reduced engagement in meaningful activities and lower overall need satisfaction. Over time,
                this imbalance can contribute to experiences of reduced emotional fulfilment and social connectedness,
                as personal resources are increasingly directed toward consumption rather than personal
                development or social bonds <br />(Kasser et al., 2014).
